# Identify the repeated pattern and replace it with a function called month_days, that receives the name of the month and the number of days in that month as parameters. Adapt the rest of the code so that the result is the same.
# Confirm your results by making a function call with the correct parameters for both months listed.

# REPLACE THIS STARTER CODE WITH YOUR FUNCTION
# def month_days(month, days):

#     print(str(month) + " "+ "has" +" "+ str(days) +" "+ "days")
#     return "\t"
# print(month_days("June",30))
# # print(month_days("July",31))

# # 1) Complete the function to return the result of the conversion
# def convert_distance(miles):
#     km = miles * 1.6 
#     return km
# my_trip_miles = 55

# # 2) Convert my_trip_miles to kilometers by calling the function above
# my_trip_km = convert_distance(my_trip_miles)

# # 3) Fill in the blank to print the result of the conversion
# print("The distance in kilometers is " + str(my_trip_km))

# # 4) Calculate the round-trip in kilometers by doubling the result,
# #    and fill in the blank to print the result
# round_trip = 2 * my_trip_km
# print("The round-trip in kilometers is " + str(round_trip))


# another program
# This function compares two numbers and returns them
# in increasing order.
# def order_numbers(number1, number2):
# 	if number2 > number1:
# 		return number1, number2
# 	else:
# 		return number2, number1

# # 1) Fill in the blanks so the print statement displays the result
# #    of the function call
# smaller, bigger = order_numbers(100, 99)
# print(smaller, bigger)
